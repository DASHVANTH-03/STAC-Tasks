# Tinkercad Basics
In this task,I learnt Aurdino basics in tinkercad by Simulate a simple LED blink using Arduino and Control the blink with a button.


## Simulate a simple LED blink using Arduino:

### Procedure
- I connected the cathode of LED directly to the ground port in aurdino and the anode to digital pin 13 with 150 Ω resistor in series.
- In programming terminal [code](Simulate a simple LED blink using Arduino/code.ino) was implemented

#### Theory:
output voltage of digital pin : 5v<br>
current rating of LED : 20 mA<br>
voltage rating of LED : 2v<br>
resistance is required in series with LED<br>
using kirchoff loop rule<br>
5 = (0.02 x r) + 2<br>
r = 150 Ω<br>

####   result:
The LED blinked

####   Inference
Output current of digital pin : 50mA
 
## Control the blink with a button:
  


## Outcome: Familiarity with Arduino simulation.
